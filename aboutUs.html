  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Tyson's Catering company was created by Tyson Stewart after he had some bad
  catering food at a friend's wedding. The food was boring, tasted odd, and gave
some people food poisoning.Tyson said to himself that "I could do better". That
 is how the business was formed.</p>
